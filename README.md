# MTA-UTSC FIFA Case comp

Welcome to our Group's solution to the MTA case comp! Within this repository, you shall find the answer to the prompt, *Defenders often need to be physically strong in order to compete and progress in 
the world cup.*

Our answer is that **Defenders do not need to be physically strong to progress in the worldcup**.

## Data
To craft our answer, we used the following data.
[Fifa 22 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-player-dataset) - For player attribute data
[Fifa 18 Results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup) - Scraped to get results of World cup

## Approach

We used multiple linear regression too see if there was a relationship between our chosen x variables and our y variables. We found that there is a weak correlation between the x variables and y, and thus there is not enough significant to 
agree that defenders need to be physically strong to progress.
